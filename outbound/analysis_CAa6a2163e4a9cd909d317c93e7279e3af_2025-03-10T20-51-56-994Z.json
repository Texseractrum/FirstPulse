The music is deafening, colorful lights strobe across the room, and several cups litter the floor, suggesting heavy drinking. Sarah's friend, who made the call, found her unconscious near a couch with vomit on the carpet close by. She has a faint pulse and shallow breathing, but she's not responding to voices or touch. People are shouting, some are panicking, and nobody seems certain about what substances Sarah might have taken. The friend is distraught, crying and shaking Sarah's shoulder, but there's no reaction. You can see a slight bluish tinge on Sarah's lips—her breathing is dangerously compromised.
