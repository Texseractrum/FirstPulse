    "final_recommendation": "The responder should focus on more comprehensive training in handling medical emergencies, particularly in guiding callers through the process of monitoring and administering first aid. It is crucial to improve the collection of detailed medical history and medication information, and to ensure the caller understands and can execute basic safety and first aid measures while waiting for emergency services. Enhanced training on maintaining structured and calm communication could further improve efficiency and effectiveness in real scenarios.",
